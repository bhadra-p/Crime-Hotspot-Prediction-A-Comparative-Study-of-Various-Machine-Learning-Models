# Crime-Hotspot-Prediction-A-Comparative-Study-of-Various-Machine-Learning-Models
The project aims to develop an intelligent system for predicting crime hotspots using 
machine learning techniques based on historical crime data. The primary objective is to build a 
robust and efficient model capable of analyzing past crime records and identifying patterns that 
indicate the likelihood of a location becoming a crime-prone area. This system is intended to 
assist law enforcement and city planners in taking proactive measures to ensure public safety 
and allocate resources more effectively.

In the scope of the project, a diverse dataset, containing detailed information about past 
criminal incidents, including the type of crime, location, and time. The dataset undergoes 
thorough preprocessing to remove inconsistencies and extract relevant features. Multiple 
machine learning algorithms are implemented to train predictive models.
The proposed system also includes a visual interface built using Streamlit, which allows 
users to interact with the model, input location features, and receive predictions regarding crime 
risk levels.
